	  <li><strong>WEB115 Web Markup and Scripting</strong> - Number one reason is because it is in my catalog, But I also want to learn how to develop and maintain a website.

	  <li><strong>MAT121 Algebra/Trigonometry</strong> - I am taking this class beacuse it is a "gen ed" (general eduacation) class in my program of study.</li>
