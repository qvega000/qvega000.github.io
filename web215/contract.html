   <p>
    I, <a href = "introduction.html">Quentin Vega</a> agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2022 WEB215-N801 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
   </p>
   <p>
    I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
   </p>
   <p>
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.
   </p>
